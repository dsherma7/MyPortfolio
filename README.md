# MyPortfolio
My work organized by category with a brief description of each project

### Data Science and Analytics
The following projects are tools I've developed to support data analytics tasks at various companies. Their languages range from R to Java to Python to Javascript depending on their needs.
1. __Linear Regression:__ A basic Linear Regression algorithm in C++. [github.com/dsherma7/LinearRegression](https://github.com/dsherma7/LinearRegression)
1. __Polyploid Dosage Calling:__ An R package that employs machine learning to predict the dosage level of a tissue sample. [github.com/dsherma7/PolyploidDosageCalling](https://github.com/dsherma7/PolyploidDosageCalling)
2. __MathNet:__ A NLP tool in Python for classifying a publication by the field of mathematics that it represents. Compares the results from a couple models including an SVM and Naive Bayes model. [github.com/dsherma7/MathNet](https://github.com/dsherma7/MathNet)
3. __Scientific Computing:__ A collection of scientific computing algorithms developed as separate pieces of code in Matlab. [github.com/dsherma7/Computing](https://github.com/dsherma7/Computing)
4. __Deep Learning API:__ A Python built web app with an easy to use UI for designing custom Deep Learning models in Tensorflow. [github.com/dsherma7/DeepLearningAPI](https://github.com/dsherma7/DeepLearningAPI)


### Visualization
The following projects were implemented using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), a [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API) 3D visualization javascript framework. Each project was built upon the last based on the order below, each with different techniques. 
1. __Volume Rendering:__ A tool that allows the user to compare different volume rendering techniques side by side on multiple datasets. [github.com/dsherma7/VolumeRendering](https://github.com/dsherma7/VolumeRendering)
2. __Scattered Interpolation:__ Compares the effectiveness of different scattered interpolation techniques including Hardy's and Shepard's methods. [github.com/dsherma7/ScatteredInterpolation](https://github.com/dsherma7/ScatteredInterpolation)
3. __Voronoi Diagrams:__ A tool for demonstrating Delauney Triangulation and Voronoi Diagrams for a collection of surfaces. [github.com/dsherma7/VoronoiDiagrams](https://github.com/dsherma7/VoronoiDiagrams)
